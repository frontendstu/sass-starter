# Using Built-In Components

Sass Starter has a few built-in components that can be used to get your project going from the start. As Sass Starter is a bare-bones template, it is up to you to create the custom properties yourself.

## Built-In Buttons

Sass starter comes with a very basic `.btn` class for you to use as a good starting point for creating buttons. From default the `.btn` class only consist of some padding, border and outline styles.

### Using the Built-In `.btn`

```html
<a href="index.html" class="btn">Button</a>
```
